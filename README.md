simple_flooder
==============

A simple_flooder tcp flooder.


How it works?
--------------

First, make.
Then, you must provide as parameters the couple host/port target and the number of connections you want to open.

ex: ./tcp_flooder localhost 8888 15000


Why? Don't you know LOIC/HOIC/whatever?
-------------

I was bored. And without reproducing performances of LOIC, I wanted to create my own flooder.
This is a basic one, but it might evolve in the future.
Another reason is I created my own IRC server, and I wanted to "stress" it.
