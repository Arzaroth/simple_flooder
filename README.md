simple_flooder
==============

A simple_flooder tcp flooder.


How it works?
--------------

1. make.
2. You must provide as parameters the couple host/port target and the number of connections you want to open.

ex: ./tcp_flooder localhost 8888 15000


Why? Don't you know LOIC/HOIC/whatever?
-------------

1. I was bored.
2. Without reproducing performances of LOIC, I wanted to create my own flooder.
3. This is a basic one, but it might evolve in the future.
4. Another reason is I created my own IRC server, and I wanted to "stress" it.
